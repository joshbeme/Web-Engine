# Web Engine

A website building CMS, inspired by game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine. This app will allow you to develop at a high level using an integrated browser window. If you are technically savvy in front end development you will also be able to update and customize the react components that are generated when constructing your website.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Development

### Bridge

Add bridge types by updating [bridge-type-schemas/index.ts](./bridge-type-schemas/index.ts). This will updates types for both the Rust process and in our React App.
